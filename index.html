	<h1 style="text-align:left">The Road</h1>

<br>
<p style="text-align:left">
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
And sorry I could not travel both<br>
And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
And looked down one as far as I could<br>
To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
</p>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p style="text-align:left">
And both that morning equally lay<br>
In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
</p>

<br>
<br>
Two roads diverged<br>
I took the one less traveled by,<br>
