	<h1>The Road Not Taken</h1>

<br>
<p style="text-align:right">
And sorry I could not travel both
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:right">
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
